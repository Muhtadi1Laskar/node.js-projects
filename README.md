## 🧩 Project Structure Example

```
project-name/
├── controllers/
├── services/
├── routes/
├── schema/
├── middleware/
├── utils/
├── index.js
└── README.md
```

Each project is **independent**, follows a **layered architecture**, and uses only **raw Node.js** — no frameworks like Express.js, Fastify, or NestJS.

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and navigate into any project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nodejs-crypto-projects.git
cd nodejs-crypto-projects/<project-name>
npm install
npm start
```

You can modify the `PORT` and other configs inside each project’s `config.js` file.
